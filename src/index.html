<h3>General information:</h3> <!-- Thats a tiny comment -->
<p>Development of the Audi TT began in September 1994 at the design center in Simi Valley, California, based on
    a design by Freeman Thomas. The interior was designed by Romulus Rost[2] and the head of the Audi design
    department was Peter Schreyer. One year later, a study of the Audi TT Coupé was presented to the public at
    the IAA in Frankfurt. This was followed in the same year by the presentation of the TT Roadster study with
    the name TTS at the Tokyo Motor Show - based on the NSU tradition with the NSU TTS. The positive response
    from visitors and motor magazine journalists led Audi to decide to build the study - with only minor design
    changes. After only three years of development, the coupé with a 1.8-liter turbo engine and a choice of <strong>132
    kW or 165 kW (180 hp or 224 hp)</strong> based on the VW Golf IV platform was launched in the fall of 1998. In
    the fall of 1999, the former TTS was introduced as the TT Roadster.
    The names of the Audi TT models tie in with the successful tradition of DKW (Auto Union) and NSU in the
    Tourist Trophy on the Isle of Man, a competition for motorcycles won by Ewald Kluge in 1938 on a DKW with a
    rotary valve engine and the NSU drivers Werner Haas and Rupert Hollaus in 1954 in their classes.
    Occasionally, the abbreviation TT is also associated with tradition and technology.</p>
